# FE_Sacred-Stones-Death-Difficulty

This is a hack of Fire Emblem - The Sacred Stones that amplifies the difficulty of the game to the max. In this hack there is no money, no growths, same turn reinforcements, and every turn the main lord has a 1/10 chance to die from random heart failure. This hack was inspired entirely by Bismix's video "Difficulty in Future Fire Emblem Games" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjYiHpnUXkA. 

Here is a link that describes how to apply a patch. You will need a copy of Fire Emblem the Sacred Stones to apply the patch to. https://feuniverse.us/t/how-to-patch-a-rom/4061
